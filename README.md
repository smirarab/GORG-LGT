Analysis of LGT across the GORG Tropics dataset. Five sets of analyses are provided here in the directories below. 

Each directory has **its own README.md** file.  

* For simulations of LGT-free genomes (Figure S6 and S1), see [GNDSim](GNDSim/)
* For tabular comparison of the LGT-free genomes see [ORFvANI](ORFvANI)
* For Figures 1b, 1c, and supplementary S8, see [GNDModel](GNDModel/)
* For Figure 3a and S4, S7 see [genetreeAAD](genetreeAAD/)
* For Figure 4c, see [16SAAD](16SAAD/)
